# Drum-Kit
This is a simple interactive Drum Kit web app made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays a set of buttons labeled w, a, s, d, j, k, and l. When a user clicks any button, a JavaScript function is triggered that shows an alert (or can play a sound). Event listeners are added to each button using querySelectorAll and a loop to make them interactive.
